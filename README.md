Tama Code Encoder/Decoder Library
=================================

This library allows you to encode and decode Tamagotchi Pix Tama Codes as
binary. You can decode the bytes from a scanned Tama Code, or encode a
Tama Code representation to bytes that you can then generate a QR code from.
The included test app serves as a demo of how to use the library.
